We will go over each of the left panels. Now is a good time to remember that you can press `1-5` to move focus to specific panels.

# 1. Status
The top-left most panel. This panel shows you the git repo you are in, the current branch, and the overall status of your repo.
- `↑` - number of commits ahead of remote
  - mnemonic: How many commits can I push up into the cloud above me?
- `↓` - number of commits behind remote
  - mnemonic: How many commits can I pull down from the cloud above me?

Additionally, it has a few cool actions:
- `e` - [[edit lazygit configuration file]]
- `ctrl+r` - [[switch to a recent git repo]]
