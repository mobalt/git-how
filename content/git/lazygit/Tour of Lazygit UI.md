To run lazygit, you first need to `cd` into a git repository. Then, you can run lazygit by simply typing `lazygit` into your terminal:
```bash
cd ./to/location/of/git-repo
lazygit
```

Now you will see the lazygit UI. It will look something like this:
- [ ] #screenshot of lazygit UI

You'll notice there are 5 panels on the left third, and then a main section on the right.
- [ ] #wireframe of 5 panels on left third, main section on right 2/3.

The 5 Left Panels are:
1. Status
2. Files
3. Local branches
4. Commits
5. Stash
