# Resetting to Remote State

## Introduction
Sometimes, a Git branch may become so problematic that the simplest solution is to reset it entirely to match the remote repository. This guide covers how to reset your local repository to mirror the remote state. Remember, these actions are irreversible and will permanently erase any uncommitted changes or local commits not present in the remote repository.

## Steps to Reset to Remote State

1. **Fetch the Latest State from Origin:**
   Fetching updates your local copy of the remote repository without modifying your working directory.
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. **Checkout the Master Branch:**
   Switch to the master branch (or any other branch you need to reset).
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   ```

3. **Reset the Branch to Match Remote:**
   This command will reset your local branch to exactly match the state of the branch on the remote repository.
   ```bash
   git reset --hard origin/master
   ```

4. **Delete Untracked Files and Directories:**
   This step cleans up any files and directories that are not tracked by Git (e.g., build artifacts, temporary files).
   ```bash
   git clean -d --force
   ```

5. **Repeat for Other Borked Branches:**
   If you have other branches that need resetting, repeat the checkout, reset, and clean steps for each one.

## Also Consider
- **Reverting All Uncommitted Changes:**
  If you have uncommitted changes you want to discard, you can use commands like `git checkout -- .` or `git reset --hard` to revert them. This is less drastic than a full branch reset and might be suitable in some cases.

## Conclusion
Resetting your local branch to the state of the remote repository is a drastic action but can be the quickest way to deal with severely corrupted or unmanageable branches. Always ensure that you have saved or backed up any important changes before performing these steps, as they cannot be undone. Be cautious with these commands, particularly in a collaborative environment.
