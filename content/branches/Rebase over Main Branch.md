# Basic Terminal
1. First checkout the feature branch that you want to rebase
```bash
git checkout feature
```
2. Then rebase it over **main** branch
```bash
git rebase main
```
3. If there are conflicts, you will need to resolve them before you can continue the rebase.
```bash
# To select changes done in base `main` branch
git checkout --ours <file>

# To select changes done in `feature` branch
git checkout --theirs <file>

# or Manually edit the file to resolve the conflict
vim <file>
```

4. Once conflicts are resolved for a file, stage the file
```bash
git add <file>
```

5. Once all conflicts are resolved, continue the rebase
```bash
git rebase --continue
```
