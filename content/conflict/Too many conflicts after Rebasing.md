# Introduction
Encountering numerous conflicts during a rebase can be daunting. This guide offers a systematic approach to address this situation, making the rebase process more manageable.

# Steps to Resolve Rebase Conflicts
1. **Abort the Current Rebase:**
   - If you're stuck in a rebase with too many conflicts, the first step is to abort it.
   ```bash
   git rebase --abort
   ```
   - This command will stop the rebase and revert your branch to the state before you started the rebase.

2. **Identify the Divergence Point:**
   - Find the commit where your branch diverged from the `main` branch.
   ```bash
   git merge-base main my-branch
   ```
   - This command will output the SHA (commit hash) of the common ancestor of your branch and `main`.

3. **Squash Commits in Your Branch:**
   - Squash all the commits in your branch into a single commit starting from the divergence point.
   ```bash
   git rebase -i $SHA_YOU_FOUND
   ```
   - Replace `$SHA_YOU_FOUND` with the SHA hash from step 2.
   - In the interactive rebase mode (`-i`), squash your commits into a single commit.

4. **Rebase on `main` Again:**
   - After squashing, rebase your branch onto the `main` branch.
   ```bash
   git rebase main
   ```
   - This time, you'll have to resolve conflicts for only one commit instead of multiple commits, simplifying the process.

# Tips for Managing Conflicts
- **Resolve conflicts incrementally:** If squashing isn't an option, consider rebasing a few commits at a time to deal with conflicts in smaller, more manageable batches.
- **Use tools for conflict resolution:** Tools like merge conflict resolution tools in text editors or IDEs can simplify the process of resolving conflicts.
- **Seek help if needed:** If the conflicts are too complex or you're unsure, don't hesitate to seek assistance from a teammate or a version control expert.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and simplify the process of resolving conflicts during a rebase.
