title: Pushing Up to Remote
---
# Lazygit
1. Press `P` (uppercase) to push up to remote.
2. If remote has changed, you will be prompted to force push.

- [ ] Add #screenshot of force push prompt

3. You probably don't want to do that, so press `esc` to cancel.
4. You probably want to pull down from remote first, so press `p` (lowercase) to pull down from remote.
5. Now you can try pushing again.

>[!Tip]
> Mnemonic:
> -  Lowercase `p`: **p**ull down from remote.
> -  Uppercase `P`: **P**ush up to remote.

# Basic Terminal
```bash
git push
```
