# Lazygit
By default, Lazygit will auto-poll for file changes every 10 seconds and auto-fetches the remote repo every minute .

To explicitly refresh:
1. Press `2`, to go to [[2. Files]]
2. Press one of the following:
    - `f` - fetch without merging
    - `R` - refresh the repo (default: autorefresh every 60 secs)
    - `r` - refresh the file systems (default: autorefresh every 10 secs)

- [ ] #discuss What is the difference between `f` fetch and `R` refresh repo? What panels?

# Basic Terminal
```bash
git fetch
```
